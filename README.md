# MovieGenreIdentifier_NaiveBayes
This is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) project. The objective of this project is to build a model that predicts the genres of a movie by taking the movie's description as input. The dataset for this project was produced by merging three different movies datasets collected from Kaggle. Every movie in the dataset has a title, a description and one or more genres. A Naive Bayes Classifier and an LSTM was trained tested on the dataset to predict the genres of the movies.

Overview of the Cleaned Dataset
- Total Movies: 4000
- Total Genres: 5
- Oldest Movie in the dataset is The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari from 1920
- Latest Movie in the dataset is The Gray Man from 2022
